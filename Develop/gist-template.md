# Hex Value RegEx Tutorial

A brief explanation of regex (regular expression) for hex values

## Summary

For starters, what is a hexadecimal code (hex code)? A hexadecimal code is actually a number system made up of 16 symbols. Those 16 symbols sometimes go by the name, base-16. These codes are very popular and one way that they can be used is in web development! CSS can utilize the power of hex codes to render the color of your choosing with numbers and letters (symbols) rather than typing out the name of the color completely. The shortened number of values needed really make hex codes easy and efficient to use.

So what goes into a hex code to make it a hex code? Well they start with these basic components:

1. "#" symbol at the beginning
2. Next are any letters a-f, A-F, and/or digits 0-9.
3. There needs to be only 6 or 3 letters and/or numbers in this type of code.

Here's and example of the regex for a hex value

`/^#?([a-fA-F0-9]{6}|[a-fA-F0-9]{3})$/`
